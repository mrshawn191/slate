# Payment Profile response codes
## Overview

This document lists the response codes returned from the Payment Profile API. The "Code" and "Description" columns correspond to the response.code and response.message properties returned by the API response object.

You should only map your responses handlers against message IDs as message strings are not guaranteed to be consistent over time.
