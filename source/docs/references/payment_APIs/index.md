# Payment APIs
Our Payment APIs are the RESTful interface to our payment gateway. It allows you to accept and analyze payments, create a payment profile to record customer details for future transactions, and create credit card tokens to reduce the scope of your PCI compliance.

You can either interact with the API directly or through an SDK (a library of helper functions to simplify your integration with the SDK).

Note: this doc is limited to the Payments, Reporting, Payment Profile, and Tokenization APIs. You may also be interested in the Onboarding API.
