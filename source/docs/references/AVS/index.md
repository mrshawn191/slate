# Address Verification System (AVS)
The [Address Verification System (AVS)][wikipedia-avs] is a system used to verify the address of a person claiming to own a credit card. The system will check the billing address of the credit card provided by the user with the address on file at the credit card company.

AVS is unable to verify all addresses as some cards may not have address information associated with them. AVS results are only returned after a transaction has completed processing. This means that a merchant must refund or void a high-risk transaction, rather than blocking it before completing the initial purchase.

You can configure your account in the [Back Office][back-office] to decline a transaction if either the street address or the postal codes do not match. Navigate to `Administration > Account Settings > Order Settings`.

AVS response codes are returned by the Payments API for purchases and pre-authorizations. You can read the Payment APIs spec [here][bambora-swagger]. They are also displayed in the transaction report in the [Back Office][back-office]. Navigate to `Reporting/Analysis > Transaction Report`.
