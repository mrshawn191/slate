# Apple Pay

## About Apple Pay

Our Payments API allows your mobile app and online store to accept payments using Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, or Safari.

## Getting Started

If this is your first time implementing our APIs we recommend reviewing our [Reference guide](/docs/references/payment_APIs/), to get familiar with Bambora's Payment APIs.

You can find more about Bambora and Apple Pay on [Github](https://github.com/bambora/na-payment-apis-demo).

## Requirements

### Registering Your Apple Pay Merchant ID

Before you accept Apple Pay with Bambora, you need to [register a Merchant ID and download a Merchant Certificate (P12)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html) with Apple.

### Configure Your P12

To enable Apple Pay on your Merchant Account, you'll set a password for your P12 using Keychain Access.

1. Under the Category menu, select **Certificates**.
2. Find and right-click your *Merchant ID* certificate. Select **Export**.
3. Ensure your File Format is set to **.Personal Information Exchange (.p12)** before clicking **Save**.
4. Enter the password you'll use when uploading your .p12 to the Member Area and click **OK**.

### Enable Apple Pay

To turn on Apple Pay for your account, log into the [Member Area](https://web.na.bambora.com). Under **configuration**, click on **mobile payments**. From the Mobile Payments screen, you can enable Apple Pay by adding your Apple Pay signing certificate.

Click **ADD NEW MERCHANT ID**, and you'll be able to add your *Apple Merchant ID*, your *P12 File Password*, and upload your P12 certificate file.

After you've added your Apple Pay certificate to your account, you can start integrating to your app.

## Accepting Apple Pay on iOS

All of the directions and code samples to enable Apple Pay in your iOS app are available through Apple's documentation. 

[Getting Started with Apple Pay](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/get-started/) will cover how to use Apple Pay and best practices, [Apple Pay Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/) has explanations of the user flow and working with Apple Pay, and [Apple Pay Sandbox Testing](https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-pay-sandbox/) will show you how to test Apple Pay transactions.

## API Requests

When you make an `apple_pay` request to our Payments API, it'll be formatted in JSON, calling to https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/payments/.

```shell
  curl https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/payments \
    -H "Authorization: Passcode XXX1XXx11Xxx1xX1XxxxXxXXXXx1XXX1XxX1XXXxXXXxXxxxX11XXXxX1" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "amount": 1.00,
          "payment_method": "apple_pay",
          "apple_pay": {
            "apple_pay_merchant_id": "<your_apple_pay_merchant_id>",
            "payment_token": "<apple_pay_base64_encoded_token>",
            "complete": true
          }
        }'
```

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| amount | The amount of the transaction. |
| payment_method | The method of payment for the transaction. For Apple Pay, this will always be `apple_pay` |
| apple_pay | The object needed to pass an Apple Pay token including the Apple Pay Merchant ID, and the base64 payment token. |
| apple_pay_merchant_id | Your Apple Merchant ID provided in your Apple Developer Account. |
| payment_token | The encrypted Apple Pay token containing card holder details, generated from within the iOS app. |
| complete | The type of transaction being performed. True indicates a Purchase, and false is a Pre-Authorisation. |

## Additional Examples

### Payment Button

The sample below shows the action taken by a payment button using Swift, generating a payment request.

```swift
func paymentButtonAction() {
    // Create a payment request
    let request = PKPaymentRequest()
    
    request.merchantIdentifier = "merchant.com.mycompany.myapp"
    request.supportedNetworks = [.visa, .masterCard, .amex]
    request.merchantCapabilities = .capability3DS
    
    // Use a currency set to match your Merchant Account
    request.countryCode = "CA" // "US"
    request.currencyCode = "CAD" // "USD"
    
    request.paymentSummaryItems = [
        PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "1 Golden Egg", amount: NSDecimalNumber(string: "1.00"), type: .final),
        PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Shipping", amount: NSDecimalNumber(string: "0.05"), type: .final),
        PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "GST Tax", amount: NSDecimalNumber(string: "0.07"), type: .final),
        PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Total", amount: NSDecimalNumber(string: "1.12"), type: .final)
    ]
    
    self.paymentAmount = NSDecimalNumber(string: "1.12")
    
    let authVC = PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController(paymentRequest: request)
    authVC.delegate = self
    present(authVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

> Note: We not only support, but recommend the use of 3D Secure with Visa, MasterCard, and America Express using `.capability3DS`.

### Issue Payment Token

This sample outlines how to handle the payment token once the payment request has been successfully authorised. To send the generated token to the server, execute the following request.

```swift
// Executes a process payment request on the Mobile Payments Demo Server
func paymentAuthorizationViewController(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController,
                                        didAuthorizePayment payment: PKPayment,
                                        completion: @escaping (PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus) -&gt; Void) {
    // Get payment data from the token and base64 encode it
    let token = payment.token
    let paymentData = token.paymentData
    let b64TokenStr = paymentData.base64EncodedString(options: NSData.Base64EncodingOptions(rawValue: 0))
    let transactionType = self.purchaseTypeSegmentedControl.selectedSegmentIndex == 0 ? "purchase" : "pre-auth"
    let parameters = [
        "amount": self.paymentAmount,
        "transaction-type": transactionType,
        "apple-wallet": [
            "payment-token": b64TokenStr,
            "apple-pay-merchant-id": "merchant.com.mycompany.myapp"
        ]
    ] as [String : Any]

    Alamofire.request(DemoServerURLBase + "/process-payment/apple-pay",
                      method: .post,
                      parameters: parameters,
                      encoding: URLEncoding.httpBody).responseJSON { response in

        let statusCode = response.response?.statusCode
                    
        if statusCode == 200 {
            completion(.success)
        }
        else {
            completion(.failure)
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: This iOS client is sending the payment token to our Payment APIs Demo Server, as outlined on [Github](https://github.com/bambora/na-payment-apis-demo).
