##  Custom Checkout

Our Custom Checkout is a client-side JavaScript library that injects credit card input elements into your web page, and then formats and validates the user input. As we host the library, it limits the scope of your PCI compliance to SAQ-A by removing the need for your browser or server code to handle credit card information.
