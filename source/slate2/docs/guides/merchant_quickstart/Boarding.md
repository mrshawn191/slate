# Go live

After you've signed up for a Merchant Account, we require a few pieces of information before your account is able to process payments.

If you haven't signed up yet, phone our Sales Team at 1 (888) 472-2072, or you can [request a call](http://www.bambora.com/en/ca/contact/sales/).

> Our Onboarding Team will guide you through each important step. If you have any questions, feel free to email them at [applications.northamerica@bambora.com](mailto:applications.northamerica@bambora.com).

## Approving  applications

After we receive your application, our Onboarding Team will review it and the accompanying paperwork within one or two business days. If we reach out to you because something is incomplete or missing, you should follow up as quickly as possible to avoid delays.

If you're exclusively using a website for payments, we will also review the website during the approval process to ensure you meet website requirements.

#### PCI questionnaires

Before your application is processed, you'll complete one of two self-assessment questionnaires about your ability to meet PCI standards.

**Self-Assessment 1**

This questionnaire is aimed at any merchant using a solution that has all payment pages hosted on a fully compliant service provider such as Bambora Checkout. If your third-party shopping cart is PCI Certified, you'll focus on this questionnaire.

[PCI Questionnaire A](https://cdn.na.bambora.com/downloads/SAQs/SAQ_A_v3_prefill.pdf)

**Self-Assessment 2**

Any merchant using a fully integrated API will complete this comprehensive questionnaire. If you create your own shopping cart using our API or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), you, your developer, as well as your host will need to complete this questionnaire.

[PCI Questionnaire D](https://cdn.na.bambora.com/downloads/SAQs/SAQ_D_v3_Merchant.pdf)

#### Website requirements

If you're selling online, your goods or services require a clear description, along with information about their price. If your customer clearly understands what they're purchasing, there's less chance for a customer dispute or chargeback.

Because of requirements from Bambora and its banking partners, you're required to clearly display the following pieces of information on your site:

 - Legal business name, or Doing Business As name (DBA) clearly and frequently.
 - Contact information for customer service, including business address and/or mailing address, telephone number, and email address.
 - An accurate and complete description of services or goods, including technical and system specifications, or individual cost.
 - A clear outline of your delivery policy, including method and delivery date for goods or services. This also includes costs, fees, and taxes related to shipping, delivering, handling, customs, duties, brokerage, and insurance. It's a good idea to also include any export restrictions that may apply.
 - Your full return, exchange, and refund policies.
 - Transaction currency for all purchases, in either Canadian or American prices.
 - The terms and conditions of the use for your website.
 - The Card Brand Mark in full colour, informing the customer of card acceptance including terms and conditions, as well as the method of payment.
 > **Card Brand Marks**<br>[Visa Merchant Services](https://www.visa.ca/en_CA/run-your-business/commercial-solutions/merchant-processing.html)<br>[MasterCard Brand Center](https://brand.mastercard.com/brandcenter/mastercard-brand-mark.html)<br>[Discover Signage and Logos](https://www.discovernetwork.com/en-us/business-resources/free-signage-logos)<br>[American Express Signs & Supplies](https://merchant-supplies.americanexpress.com/?locale=en_US#/)</br>

After we've confirmed this information is readily available on your website, we can start work on issuing your Merchant Account. If you have questions about any of these requirements, or need more detail on making them available, contact our [Customer Experience Team](https://www.bambora.com/en/ca/contact/support/).

### Setting up your website

If you're unsure about any steps in the process including the use of logos, process flow, or requirements, refer to our [Interac Online Integration Guide](https://support.na.bambora.com/bic/w/Properties/External_PDFs/bambora-interac-integration.pdf).

#### Interac Online Certification

After you've turned in your Merchant Checklist, we will perform a full test transaction on your account. After the test is successfully confirmed, we will contact our Interac partners to finalize the account setup.

## Integrating
You can begin to test your system's integration using [these test cards](http://support.na.bambora.com/olm/w/docs/using-test-card-numbers.htm) in your sandbox environment. Each currency requires its own Merchant ID, so if you intend on accepting multiple currencies, you will need to create a new integration for each one.

After integration tests are complete, as well as your terminal and merchant accounts are confirmed, we'll send you an email to the address you provided, authorizing you to go live.

> We recommend that you review our guide to [Security and Risk Management](https://support.na.bambora.com/bic/w/index.html#docs/security-risk-management.htm) for enhanced security featuresand best practices.

## Going live

Once you or your developer finish testing, send us an email requesting to go live, and we will make it so. You'll move from the test environment to live on production.

We'll perform a review of your website to ensure everything is running smoothly. If we detect any issues or problems, we'll send you an email concerning your site review. 

> Test transactions will remain free of charge, but monthly processing fees will start from the point your account goes live.
