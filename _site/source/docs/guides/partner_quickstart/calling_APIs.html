<h1 id="calling-the-onboarding-apis">Calling the Onboarding APIs</h1>

<p>This will guide you through quickly hitting one of our Onboarding API endpoints.</p>

<p>This API requires an authentication passcode from a partner account that you requested in the setup stage of this Quickstart Guide.</p>

<p>The Onboarding API endpoints are divided by account type, or ‘flow’. This guide will focus on ‘psp-cad’.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-partial-application">1. Create a partial application</h2>
<p><code>shell
curl https://uat-onboarding-api.beanstream.com/v1/workflows/psp-cad/applications  \
  -H "Authorization: Passcode your_onboarding_passcode"  \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "pricing_id":"ABC123",
  "applicant":{
    "first_name":"John",
    "last_name":"Doe",
    "phone_number":"222-222-2222",
    "date_of_birth":"2013-03-25T22:04:10.04399Z",
    "email":"buser2@beanstream.com"
  }
}'
</code></p>

<p>You will receive a response with a HTTP status 201 Created. The response body will have an ID, a state, and an array of pending fields. The state of an application will remain ‘in_progress’ until all required fields have been submitted.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-the-partial-application">2. Retrieve the partial application</h2>

<p><code>
curl https://uat-onboarding-api.beanstream.com/v1/workflows/psp-cad/applications/{applicationId}
</code></p>

<p>Using the ID returned from your first request you can now request the submitted application.</p>
