<h2 id="about-android-pay">About Android Pay</h2>

<p>Our Payments API allows your mobile app and online store to accept payments through Android devices or from a desktop using Google Chome.</p>

<p>When your customers use Android Pay, a virtual account number is used to represent their payment. No card details are sent with the transaction, keeping them safe and secure.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>If this is your first time implementing our APIs we recommend reviewing our <a href="/docs/references/payment_APIs/">Reference guide</a>, to get familiar with Bambora’s Payment APIs.</p>

<p>You can find more about Bambora and Android Pay on <a href="https://github.com/bambora/na-payment-apis-demo">Github</a>.</p>

<h3 id="payment-button">Payment button</h3>

<p>The sample below shows the action taken by a payment button in an Android app, generating a payment request.</p>

<p>```java
SupportWalletFragment walletFragment = SupportWalletFragment.newInstance(walletFragmentOptions);</p>

<p>MaskedWalletRequest maskedWalletRequest = WalletUtil.createMaskedWalletRequest(
        itemsToPurchase,
        getString(R.string.public_key));</p>

<p>WalletFragmentInitParams.Builder startParamsBuilder = WalletFragmentInitParams.newBuilder()
        .setMaskedWalletRequest(maskedWalletRequest)
        .setMaskedWalletRequestCode(REQUEST_CODE_MASKED_WALLET);</p>

<p>walletFragment.initialize(startParamsBuilder.build());</p>

<p>getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
        .replace(R.id.android_pay_container, walletFragment)
        .commit();
```</p>

<h3 id="process-payment-token">Process payment token</h3>

<p>Your app will receive a payment token once the payment request has been successfully authorised. You then need to send the payment token to your server, and then from there send it to the Bambora Payments API.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can view additional source code examples for a demo Android client &amp; payment server that implements sending a payment token to the Bambora Payments API here: <a href="https://github.com/bambora/na-payment-apis-demo">Payments API Demo on Github</a>.</p>
