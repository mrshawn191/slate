<h2 id="approving--applications">Approving  applications</h2>

<p>After we receive your application, our Onboarding Team will review it and the accompanying paperwork within one or two business days. If we reach out to you because something is incomplete or missing, you should follow up as quickly as possible to avoid delays.</p>

<p>If you’re exclusively using a website for payments, we will also review the website during the approval process to ensure you meet website requirements.</p>

<h4 id="pci-questionnaires">PCI questionnaires</h4>

<p>Before your application is processed, you’ll complete one of two self-assessment questionnaires about your ability to meet PCI standards.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Assessment 1</strong></p>

<p>This questionnaire is aimed at any merchant using a solution that has all payment pages hosted on a fully compliant service provider such as Bambora Checkout. If your third-party shopping cart is PCI Certified, you’ll focus on this questionnaire.</p>

<p><a href="https://cdn.na.bambora.com/downloads/SAQs/SAQ_A_v3_prefill.pdf">PCI Questionnaire A</a></p>

<p><strong>Self-Assessment 2</strong></p>

<p>Any merchant using a fully integrated API will complete this comprehensive questionnaire. If you create your own shopping cart using our API or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), you, your developer, as well as your host will need to complete this questionnaire.</p>

<h4 id="website-requirements">Website requirements</h4>

<p>If you’re selling online, your goods or services require a clear description, along with information about their price. If your customer clearly understands what they’re purchasing, there’s less chance for a customer dispute or chargeback.</p>

<p>Because of requirements from Bambora and its banking partners, you’re required to clearly display the following pieces of information on your site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal business name, or Doing Business As name (DBA) clearly and frequently.</li>
  <li>Contact information for customer service, including business address and/or mailing address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
  <li>An accurate and complete description of services or goods, including technical and system specifications, or individual cost.</li>
  <li>A clear outline of your delivery policy, including method and delivery date for goods or services. This also includes costs, fees, and taxes related to shipping, delivering, handling, customs, duties, brokerage, and insurance. It’s a good idea to also include any export restrictions that may apply.</li>
  <li>Your full return, exchange, and refund policies.</li>
  <li>Transaction currency for all purchases, in either Canadian or American prices.</li>
  <li>The terms and conditions of the use for your website.</li>
  <li>The Card Brand Mark in full colour, informing the customer of card acceptance including terms and conditions, as well as the method of payment.
