<h1 id="bank-response-codes">Bank response codes</h1>
<p>## Overview</p>

<p>This document lists the bank related response codes returned from the Payment API. The “Message ID” and “Cardholder message” columns correspond to the <code>messageID</code> and <code>messageText</code> properties returned by the API response object. The “Merchant message” column contains an additional detailed message that is not returned by the API.</p>

<p>Responses are broken into 3 groups: gateway, credit card and Interac Online.
Responses related to credit card transactions are sub-grouped by processor (Chase Paymentech, Desjardins, Elavon, First Data, Global, TD, Vital). If you are processing transactions against a test account you will receive responses from our emulator, rather than a processor.</p>

<p>You should only map your responses handlers against message IDs as message strings are not guaranteed to be consistent over time.</p>
