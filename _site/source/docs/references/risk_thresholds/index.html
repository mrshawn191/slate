<h1 id="risk-thresholds">RISK THRESHOLDS</h1>
<p>Risk Thresholds can be used by merchants to block certain high-risk transactions. With this service, we determine the risk of each transaction using a number of monitoring elements such as geolocation checks, proxy detection, IP tracking, and Bank Identification Number checks. Based on this evaluation, transactions are assigned a risk score between 0.01 and 100. The risk score represents the percentage of probability that the transaction is fraudulent. For example, a score of 10 represents a 10% possibility that the transaction is fraudulent. A score of 90 represents a 90% possibility the transaction is fraudulent.</p>

<p>If a transaction is assigned a risk score greater than or equal to the threshold set in the decline field, the transaction is not processed. You will receive an email message for transactions with a risk score lower than the decline threshold but greater than or equal to the warn threshold.</p>

<p>Merchants using the API must use security authentication and include the customer IP (customer_ip) to ensure an accurate risk score output. This is done automatically when using the payment form when billing address is required.</p>

<h2 id="required-fields-for-transactions">Required fields for Transactions</h2>
<p>To get an accurate Risk Threshold result, there are several minimally required fields in the transaction. Where possible, the merchant should send us the information in these fields to generate the most useful riskScore.</p>

<p>Based on millions of evaluated transactions, the table below shows a breakdown of how many transactions by percentage, that make up the different score ranges. You can use this data to help you better determine the thresholds that are appropriate for your business, based on your comfort level with the number of transactions that could be blocked.</p>
