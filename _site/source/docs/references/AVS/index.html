<h1 id="address-verification-system-avs">Address Verification System (AVS)</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System">Address Verification System (AVS)</a> is a system used to verify the address of a person claiming to own a credit card. The system will check the billing address of the credit card provided by the user with the address on file at the credit card company.</p>

<p>AVS is unable to verify all addresses as some cards may not have address information associated with them. AVS results are only returned after a transaction has completed processing. This means that a merchant must refund or void a high-risk transaction, rather than blocking it before completing the initial purchase.</p>

<p>You can configure your account in the <a href="https://web.na.bambora.com">Back Office</a> to decline a transaction if either the street address or the postal codes do not match. Navigate to <code>Administration &gt; Account Settings &gt; Order Settings</code>.</p>

<p>AVS response codes are returned by the Payments API for purchases and pre-authorizations. You can read the Payment APIs spec <a href="/docs/references/payment_APIs/">here</a>. They are also displayed in the transaction report in the <a href="https://web.na.bambora.com">Back Office</a>. Navigate to <code>Reporting/Analysis &gt; Transaction Report</code>.</p>
