<h1 id="payment-apis">Payment APIs</h1>
<p>Our Payment APIs are the RESTful interface to our payment gateway. It allows you to accept and analyze payments, create a payment profile to record customer details for future transactions, and create credit card tokens to reduce the scope of your PCI compliance.</p>

<p>You can either interact with the API directly or through an SDK (a library of helper functions to simplify your integration with the SDK).</p>

<p>Note: this doc is limited to the Payments, Reporting, Payment Profile, and Tokenization APIs. You may also be interested in the Onboarding API.</p>
